Meant to Be
Romance

The light drizzle in the Seattle air caused Becca to pull the hood of her jacket over her head as she crossed the street toward the coffee shop she frequented every morning. It was because of the hood that she did not see the Prius heading toward her at an alarming speed. Becca heard the sound of tires on wet pavement and looked up just in time to think that she was a goner. “user1_1”, she exclaimed, putting her arms up in a defensive gesture. Moments before the car hit her, someone rushed into the street, snatching her off her feet and onto the sidewalk. 

“Are you alright?” The handsome stranger looked into her eyes, concern making his voice husky. The moment Becca’s eyes met his, she was lost forever. She felt heat rise up in her cheeks and became very aware of the stranger’s hands on her body. She nodded, unable to speak. “I’m Tom.” The beautiful man said. His face was also flushed. He lifted a hand to her face, caressing her cheek gently. “user2_1”, he said softly. 

Becca was drowning in his eyes so that she barely noticed that he wasn’t making any sense. He helped her up gently. “Forgive me,” he said, “I am overwhelmed by your beauty and find myself at a loss for words.” Becca almost swooned at that. She looked up at him, pulling him close and whispered, “user1_2”, into his ear. He smiled at her. “Will you walk with me?” Tom asked in a voice that was almost pleading. 

They walked hand in hand for a while. Tom turned to Becca. “I have something I need to tell you.” He took a deep breath, “user2_2”. He cleared his throat, “Also, I’m a werewolf.” Becca gasped, her hand flying up to her mouth. “user1_3”, she exclaimed, “but I will love you always! We are meant to be. Even if that means helping you fight your nature of the beast.” Tom, tears glistening in his eyes, said, “user2_3”. Then he kissed Becca long and deep.
