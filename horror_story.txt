A Walk in the Woods
Horror

It was a brisk October evening. After dinner and beers at the local tavern a young couple decided to take a walk in the woods. The trees were resplendent in hues of red, orange, and yellow. However, the trail was faint, and as the sky turned dark it became increasingly difficult to see the path and soon they were lost. John said "we might as well settle in and start a fire. We will never make our way out these woods in the dark." John was not surprised when his girlfriend Mandy replied, "user1_1".

John replied in his typically dismissive manner, "You aren't even making any sense....." when he was suddenly startled by a noise. "user2_1", he exclaimed, but it was too dark to see anything. He thought he heard things off to his right, and whispered in that direction "user2_2". From his left he heard a faint, barely audible reply from Mandy. "user1_2", she whispered.

"Run!" he yelled, and he bolted to the left. All he could hear was the commotion of his own flight, and his cries of "Run, Mandy! This way!" As he crashed through the brush he couldn't help but to wonder if there really was anything behind him. He slowed his pace even as his heart continued to thunder in his chest. He called out softly, "Mandy?" but recieved no response. He tried again, and heard nothing.

Now, lost and alone, unable to see, the fear again began to overwhelm him. In the silence of the dark forest all he could hear was the pounding in his chest and the fear in his mind. Suddenly a piercing cry rang out which drowned out every other sound he had ever heard. "user2_3", were the last words Mandy ever said. Again he was running as hard as he could. Running driven by both fear and loss. When the dagger pierced his chest it took him soom time to realize it. Just before he lost conciousness, the words "user1_3" bubled forth from his lips.
